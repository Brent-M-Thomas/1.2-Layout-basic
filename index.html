        <h1>High Expectations Lead to Higher Performance</h1>
            <p><em>By Jesse Wolgamott, Houston Rails Engineering Instructor.</em> June 2015</p>
            <p>I was blown away by a recent podcast on This American Life, professionally and personally. I searched for an episode, saw one named “Batman”, and instantly jumped on it. Full disclosure: no super heroes, just life changing thinking about the impact of our expectations on people we interact with.</p>
        <h1>Impact on The Iron Yard</h1>
            <p>I expect the best effort possible from Students at The Iron Yard. From before we start classes, our students prepare their mind with prework, readings, and playful coding experiments. During the course, we stretch their mind daily with quizzes, exercises, and discussions. Nightly, our future developers apply what they learned in class and deliver functional software that pushes their ability to the limit.</p>

            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
